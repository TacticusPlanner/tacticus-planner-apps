## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Desktop table uses fixed-width, static columns at a fixed row height

At or above the mobile breakpoint (see the platform-switch requirement below), the Goals list SHALL render as a table with these columns, in order: Character, Goal, Progress, Remaining, "Status · Done by", and Actions. These columns SHALL remain static: none of them SHALL be hidden or added based on the table's or viewport's width — the only layout change at any desktop width is the fixed set of columns above, and the only responsive change at all is the 768px table→card switch (see the platform-switch requirement below). A column set that changes with width was tried and rejected: it made the page feel like it was "jumping" as the table resized. The Character column SHALL show the unit's avatar, its name as a link, and the goal type as a small muted-foreground caption beneath the name; the previously separate Type column is removed. (No coloured dot: this repo has no existing per-goal-type colour token to reuse, and it was dropped as a cosmetic mockup detail with no testable scenario.) The Goal column SHALL show the goal's from → to representation (rank icons, "Lv 44 → 50", or "273 / 500 shards", matching each goal kind's existing target representation). The "Status · Done by" column SHALL show the goal's Active/Blocked/etc. status label(s) on one line, with the existing `goal-list-estimate-display` "Done By" date-and-day-count content on a second line directly beneath when a completion estimate is available; when no estimate is available, the second line SHALL be omitted rather than showing a placeholder. The Actions column SHALL render the row's project-removal-or-move and Delete actions as inline icon buttons, alongside the existing primary pause/resume icon (see `goal-status-actions`'s "Pause and resume are primary row actions"), rather than only inside the "⋯" menu; the "⋯" menu SHALL render only when it still has at least one applicable item (Archive or Unarchive). Its column header text SHALL remain present for assistive technology but SHALL NOT render visibly.

Each row SHALL render at a fixed height sized to one line of content per column (with the Character and "Status · Done by" columns' two stacked lines accommodated within that same fixed height), a substantial reduction from today's variable, content-driven row height. The existing alternating row (zebra) striping SHALL be preserved.

When the table renders on a route where inline reordering is available (the Goals page and project detail — see `global-goal-priority`'s "Owner can reorder from Goals" and `project-management`'s "Goals are reordered individually via inline drag"), each Active or Paused row SHALL additionally show a leading drag handle before the Character column. This handle is a control affordance, not a seventh data column, and does not change the six static columns above; it is present only in a reorderable context and absent elsewhere (for example, the Insights page or any list that is not in priority order), which is a context-conditional distinction, not the width-conditional column-hiding this requirement otherwise prohibits.

Assumptions:

- Column widths are a layout implementation detail (not restated here in pixels); the ordering, content, and fixed row height are the externally observable, testable behavior.

#### Scenario: A goal with a completion estimate

- **GIVEN** a Rank goal has status "Active", is "Blocked", and has a computed completion estimate of October 11th (in 22 days)
- **WHEN** the row renders
- **THEN** the "Status · Done by" column shows "Active" and "Blocked" on the first line and "📅 Oct 11 · in 22 days" on the second line

#### Scenario: A goal with no completion estimate

- **GIVEN** a goal has status "Active" and no computed completion estimate (no project selected, or the goal kind is not farmable)
- **WHEN** the row renders
- **THEN** the "Status · Done by" column shows only "Active", with no second line and no placeholder such as "—"

#### Scenario: The Remaining column stays visible at every desktop width

- **GIVEN** the viewport is at or above the mobile breakpoint, at any desktop width
- **WHEN** the Goals list renders
- **THEN** it renders as a table with all six columns, Remaining included — no width threshold hides or restores it

#### Scenario: A drag handle appears only in a reorderable context

- **GIVEN** the same Active goal renders once on the Goals page and once in a list that is not reorderable
- **WHEN** each list renders as a desktop table
- **THEN** the Goals page row shows a leading drag handle and the other row does not, with both rows otherwise showing the same six columns

#### Scenario: Project-removal-or-move and Delete render as icons on desktop

- **GIVEN** the Goals list renders as a desktop table
- **WHEN** a row's Actions column renders
- **THEN** its project-removal-or-move action and Delete each render as their own icon button in the row, not only as items inside a "⋯" menu

#### Scenario: The "⋯" menu is absent when it would otherwise be empty

- **GIVEN** a goal is Active or Paused and has not reached its target (Archive is unavailable) and is not Archived (Unarchive is unavailable)
- **WHEN** its row renders as a desktop table
- **THEN** no "⋯" menu trigger is rendered, since it would offer nothing

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: In-flight rows show their account-wide priority position

Wherever the Goals list renders Active or Paused goals in priority order — the Goals page (`/plan/goals`) and a project's detail route — each such row SHALL show the goal's account-wide priority position (`globalPriority`, 1 to N across every Active and Paused goal) as visible text in the row's leading cell beside the drag handle on the desktop table, and in the card header on mobile. The position is not a seventh column and SHALL NOT change the six-column contract. It SHALL be the goal's position in the whole account order, never its index among the visible rows: with filters, Group, or a project view, the visible rows show non-consecutive numbers. Rows without a position (Reached, Completed, or Archived goals) SHALL show none and SHALL leave the leading cell empty. The number SHALL appear in Comfortable and Compact density and on mobile cards, SHALL meet the text-contrast rules of `goal-visual-accessibility`, and SHALL be part of the row's accessible name or description (for example "Priority 3"). While a reorder is in flight or awaiting rollback, the numbers SHALL follow the same optimistic update as the order: the moved goal takes the displaced goal's number and the goals between them shift by one, reverting with the order on rollback.

#### Scenario: Active and Paused rows show a position

- **GIVEN** the account has goals with global positions 1 to 5, one of them Paused
- **WHEN** the Goals page renders unfiltered
- **THEN** every row shows its number 1 to 5 in the leading cell, including the Paused one

#### Scenario: Goals without a position show none

- **GIVEN** a Reached, Completed, or Archived goal is visible
- **WHEN** its row renders
- **THEN** no priority number is shown and the row keeps the same layout as its neighbours

#### Scenario: Filtered or project views show account-wide numbers

- **GIVEN** global order A, B, C, D, E (positions 1 to 5) and a project holding A, C, and E
- **WHEN** the project's detail route renders
- **THEN** its rows show 1, 3, and 5, not 1, 2, and 3, and the same goals show the same numbers on the Goals page

#### Scenario: Compact density and mobile cards keep the number

- **WHEN** the list renders in Compact density on desktop, or as mobile cards below 768px
- **THEN** each Active or Paused row or card still shows its number

#### Scenario: A reorder updates the numbers optimistically

- **GIVEN** global order A, B, C, D, E and a project holding A, C, and E
- **WHEN** the user moves E onto C in the project's detail route
- **THEN** the rows immediately read A 1, E 3, C 4, and the Goals page shows A 1, B 2, E 3, C 4, D 5
- **AND** if the move is rejected the numbers return to A 1, C 3, E 5
